### Project Description:
This repository contains the development of a Finance Management System, a project for ICSI518 - Software Engineering at the University at Albany. The system is designed to help users manage their finances, track income and expenses, set budgets, and offer predictive insights using machine learning models.

### Important features include:

- **Individual User Features:**
  - Individual users can add, edit, and delete expenses to better manage their financial records.
  - Individual users can monitor and manage their expenses and income efficiently.
  - Individual users can track and manage recurring payments, such as rent and loans, to stay on top of their commitments.
  - Individual users can project their monthly revenue and create budgets for better financial planning.
  - Individual users can establish limitations for several categories, such as food and housing, to control their spending.
  - Individual users can set savings and investment goals and track their progress over time.
  - Individual users can receive notifications for recurring payments to avoid missed deadlines.
  - Individual users can establish restrictions on specific expenditure categories (e.g., food) and receive alerts when they approach or exceed those thresholds.
  - Individual users can calculate their financial health score based on income, expenditures, liabilities, and savings.
  - Individual users can predict future expenditures using historical data for better planning using machine learning model.
  - Individual users can forecast their loan eligibility based on their financial history using machine learning model. 

- **Group User Features:**
  - Group users can add detailed group expenses, including descriptions, amounts, and categories, so that all members can track shared financial activities.
  - Group users can categorize group expenses by type (e.g., food, rent, utilities) for better analysis of spending patterns.
  - Group users can create new groups with unique names and purposes to collaborate on shared expenses.
  - Group admins can add or remove members from the group to maintain accurate participation and financial records.
  - Group users can view a financial dashboard that summarizes balances and recent activities, providing an overview of the groupâ€™s financial status.
  - Group users can monitor all group expenses and payments, including timestamps and member contributions, for transparency and accountability.
  - Group users can forecast shared expenses based on historical data and trends to plan for future financial commitments using machine learning model.
  - Group users can rely on the system to identify and flag unusual spending patterns or discrepancies to ensure accountability and prevent misuse of funds using machine learning model.
